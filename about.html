                    <h1>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy role-playing game first published in 1974. Most players role-play adventuring characters such as an elf warlock or dwarf paladin. One player is the Dungeon Master who facilitates the game, controls the monsters and non-player characters, and narrates the story.
                   Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a game which never ends, in which anything is possible and which no-one and everyone wins. <br> <br> Sound confusing? It’s surprisingly straightforward!</p>

                   <h1>Who can play Dungeons & Dragons?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Anyone! Dungeons & Dragons is very cheap and easy to setup, all you need is yourself, some friends, an imagination, and possibly some equipment to enchance the experience that is mentioned below.</p>

                    <h1>What do I need to start my first game of Dungeons & Dragons?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Four or five players plus the Dungeon Master is a good number. It's a manageable number of players for the Dungeon Master to keep track of, everyone can fit around a dining table and it allows for a good amount of player interaction and strategy.
                    Dungeons and Dragons can be played with two players but you may need to flex the roles from the standard set up. With two players you may both want to have a character and share the DM role or have the player control multiple characters.
                    <br><br>Having paper and pencil, dice, and even minifigures can enchance the experience, but there are plenty of online resources that can provide a digital version of any of these.</p>
